## Position
Junior Frontend Development  
full-time  

## About me
While I was at school, I was fond of optional programming in the Pascal language. At the university, I successfully developed a primitive website in html. In the magistracy, I successfully completed practical tasks in the Delphi language. In my job, I come across the work of sites from the customer side.  
I believe that I can become a good frontend developer, as my strengths are analytical and logical thinking, perseverance, patience, diligence, dedication.  
I am self-educating on practical courses on programming from Hexlet.

        for (let i = 0; i < glove.length; i++) {
            if (glove[i - 1] === glove[i]) {
                pairs++;
