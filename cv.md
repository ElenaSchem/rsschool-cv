## Position
Junior Frontend Development  
full-time  

## About me
While I was at school, I was fond of optional programming in the Pascal language. At the university, I successfully developed a primitive website in html. In the magistracy, I successfully completed practical tasks in the Delphi language. In my job, I come across the work of sites from the customer side.  
I believe that I can become a good frontend developer, as my strengths are analytical and logical thinking, perseverance, patience, diligence, dedication.  
I am self-educating on practical courses on programming from Hexlet.  

## Skills
* HTML, CSS  
* JavaScript Basics  
* Git, GitHub  
* Figma, Adobe Photoshop  
* VS Code, Trello, LeaderTask  

## Code example:
    let arr = [];  
        for (i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {  
            arr[i] = +prompt(`Введите ${i} элемент массива`);  
        }  

        let max = arr[0];  
        let n = 0;  
        for (i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {  
            if (arr[i] > max) {  
                max = arr[i];  
                n = i;  
            };  
        }  

    alert (`Макс = ${max}; Номер = ${n}`);
