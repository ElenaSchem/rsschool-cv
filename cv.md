## Position
Junior Frontend Development  
full-time  

## About me
While I was at school, I was fond of optional programming in the Pascal language. At the university, I successfully developed a primitive website in html. In the magistracy, I successfully completed practical tasks in the Delphi language. In my job, I come across the work of sites from the customer side.  
I believe that I can become a good frontend developer, as my strengths are analytical and logical thinking, perseverance, patience, diligence, dedication. Graduated: "Website development basics" at the BELHARD Academy (2021), "UI / UX-design" at the IT-school MyFreedom (2020).  
I am taking the course "Modern Front-End using JavaScript and HTML5" at the BELHARD Academy.  
And also I am self-educating on practical courses on programming from Hexlet.  
I go hiking and rafting, play the guitar, meditate. I am interested in personal development and psychology (books, trainings).

## Code example:
    let arr = [];  
        for (i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {  
            arr[i] = +prompt(`Введите ${i} элемент массива`);  
        }  

        let max = arr[0];  
        let n = 0;  
        for (i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {  
            if (arr[i] > max) {  
                max = arr[i];  
                n = i;  
            };  
        }  

    alert (`Макс = ${max}; Номер = ${n}`);
